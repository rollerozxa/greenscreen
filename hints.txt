Greenscreen usage hints:

1. Due to its eyesore nature, it cannot be crafted, nor found.
   It is only found in the creative menu.

2. Don't type "Colour screen (#HEX)" when doing node operations.
   Instead, opt for the more easily remembered "greenscreen:colourscreen".

3. Please be careful when editing scenario.
   The nodes are dug instantly, as to make building and correcting easier.

4. They always glow!
   This gives you 100% luminosity when around the nodes, thus maintaining the
   original colour at all times, even at night.

5. Use it in showoff screenshot for mods!
   This, using some editing, can make for some professional looking screenshots.

6. It's not just a transparent screen!
   You can use the white nodes to make lights or the black ones to make endless pits.
   Or, you can use them to make surreal looking maps, maybe even the Rainbow Road!

7. Have fun!
